# 🚗 Visualization Tool for Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize Electric Vehicle (EV) data from multiple sources to better understand trends in EV range, charging infrastructure, and market growth both in India and globally. The analysis is presented through interactive dashboards and stories using Tableau, which are integrated into a web application for easy access.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Electric Vehicles are becoming a vital part of modern transportation systems. However, understanding their performance, adoption, and infrastructure requires analyzing data from various sources. This project brings together four distinct datasets to build a comprehensive visualization dashboard and story.

---

## 📁 Datasets Used

- **EV Specifications Dataset**: Model, range, battery capacity, price.
- **Charging Infrastructure Dataset**: Location, type, and availability of charging stations.
- **EV Sales Dataset**: Year-wise EV sales across regions and manufacturers.
- **Battery Performance Dataset**: Environmental effects on range and battery life.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   Clean and structure data using Excel/Google Sheets. Handle missing values and unify formats.

3. **Data Import & Integration**  
   Connect Tableau Desktop to the prepared data sources.

4. **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
   Create visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, heatmaps, and geo-maps to answer key business questions.

5. **Dashboard Development**  
   Combine visualizations into a cohesive Tableau dashboard with interactive filters and metrics.

6. **Storyboarding**  
   Build a Tableau Story to narrate insights and findings sequentially.

7. **Publishing to Tableau Public**  
   Host dashboards and stories on Tableau Public to obtain shareable links.

8. **Web Application Development**  
   Create a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and React. Embed Tableau visualizations using `<iframe>`.
